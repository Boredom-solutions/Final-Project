As we are aware of COVID-19, also known Coronavirus, and the kind of challenges and disasters that it has caused in a single year. World wide, cases are once again rising and forcing countries to tighten restrictions on businesses and edging towards another shut down. In order to prevent the spread, and possible second government-mandated quarantine, every single person need to take percautions and responsibility for limiting the spread of the virus. Accoring to both the World Health Organizaiton and the CDC the best ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19 are as follows:
<ul>
	<li>Washing your hands</li>
	<li>Maintaining a distance of 6ft or more when in public</li>
	<li>Wearing a mask that covers your mouth and nose when in public</li>
	<li>Social distancing (staying home and away from people)</li>
</ul>
All of these are proven to be effective in limiting the spread and preventing people from contracting the virus.
<h3>It is also obvious that in general people do not generally wish to stay home due to the fact that they are faced with the bordem that comes with the limited activities available to them inside their own homes. Well we have devised a solution. In order to promote social distancing and individuals staying home, we have designed this website to provide randomized content and activities to help combat the onset of bordem and hopefully encourage people to stay at home more often.
