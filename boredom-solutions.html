 <h1>Boredom Solutions</h1> 
<p> Our main goal by creating this website is to promote social distancing and supply a source of entertainment and information for individuals while they remain in their homes. Below you will find multiple links to activities. These activities are selected based on their content being able to be replicated by everyone, such as exercises using everyday household objects instead of gym equipment. And with all content being randomized, it takes away the difficulty of choosing something to watch or do. This method can also introduce users to content that they normally would overlook, allowing for them to be exposed to new ideas and activities they may actually find they enjoy.</p>
